Find out when your users last logged into your site.

== Description ==

If you have users who haven't been on your site for ages, or even registered, and never returned, this is the plugin for you. It creates the ability for your site to start recording when your users login, so you can see exactly when they last did.

Then, the plugin provides a simple user table so you can see the last login date and time for each of your users. The user email is also displayed, so you can make contact and persuade them to come back. You can also delete one or many users directly from the table.

== Pro Features ==

The Pro Edition builds on the free version by adding some cool features.

* Set an inactive date, for example six months, after which your users become 'inactive'.
* Set a grace period, which gives users a final period of time by when they must Login.
* Send an email to users warning them they have to login by a certain date or they may be removed.
* Enhanced user table to filter users who are inactive, or in a grace period.
* Deletion queue to quickly remove all inactive users from your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the table show 'No Data' instead of a date and time? =

When you first install the plugin, you will see 'No Data' displayed for each user. This is because WordPress does not automatically record the date and time a user logs in, so Active User has to do it instead. As your users continue to access your site, you will start to see data.

= How does the plugin integrate with BuddyPress? =

Active User is fully compatible with BuddyPress. If BuddyPress is activated on your site, you will immediately see last activity data in the plugin table. This is because BuddyPress records last activity data from the start. For a BuddyPress site, the time and date displayed reflects the users last activity, instead of when the logged in, as this is more accurate.

= Is Active User safe to use? =

Active User features a deletion confirmation system that mirrors WordPress's own. When you delete a user from the plugin table, you will be given the option of attributing any content to another user.
